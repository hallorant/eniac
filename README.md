Assembler for the 1948/1951 ENIAC Converter Code.

This work was motivated by the book [ENIAC in Action](https://eniacinaction.com/) by Haigh, Pristley, and Rope.

Realize that this is not a recreation. As far as I know no such assembler ever existed. At the time programmers hand-assembled into to machine code for the ENIAC Converter Code.
